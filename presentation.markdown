# Culture Intro (3min)
##Common views of culture
- Sophistication (laymen)
- Customs and rituals (anthropologists)
- Norms around handling people and espoused values of organization (industrial psychologists)
  - Confusing because confuses culture with *what culture ought to be*
  - Managers want to develop "the right kind of culture"
  - Based on the idea that culture is something management tries to inject 

##Culture points to phenomena below the surface
  - We see the behaviors and actions resulting of culture, but can't always pinpoint the underlying forces

##Models of culture
  - Observed behavioral regularities: language used, customs and traditions. 
    - Startups: "disrupt", using macs, all-night coding sessions, junk food, quirky offices
  - Espoused values
    - Amazon: most customer-centric in the world
    - Buffer: open salaries
  - Climate: The feeling conveyed in the group
    - Physical layout
    - Group interactions (military: strict chain of command)

##Why define culture at all?
  We have so many other words, like norms, values, traditions, rituals.
  Culture adds important elements:
  - Structural Stability
    - Something is cultural because it defines the group
    - Even if some group members leave, culture remains.
    - Culture is hard to change because it brings order and predictability. 
  - Depth
    - Deep and unconscious
    - The models are manifestations of culture
  - Breadth
    - Pervasive and influences all aspects of a group's functioning
  - Social Learning
    - People try to make order out of a disorderly environment, making sense of "the way things should be"
    - A social unit with a shared history will evolve a culture to deal with uncertainty
      - Can't make every decision from the ground up. Can't question every little thing.

##Formal Definition

The culture of a group can now be defined as a pattern of shared basic assumptions learned by a group as it solved its problems of external adaptation and internal integration, which has worked well enough to be considered valid and, therefore, to be taught to new members as the correct way to perceive, think, and feel in relation to those problems.

Break this down by bolding different pieces.

# How Leaders Embed and Transmit Culture
## Primary Embedding Mechanisms
### Conscious Attention
- Consistently paying attention to Alcoa

## Sources of Culture
- Beliefs and values of founders
- Learning experiences of group members
- Beliefs and values that new members bring

Hogwarts cultural beliefs

My primary learning was here: since culture is so pervasive, it's important for for leaders both to 
start the group off on the right foot by influencing the initial culture and also to allow
culture to adapt to a changing environment.

# Examples of how cultures that don't change fail.
Rigidity
 - Beta, a large urban utility, consulted the author of this book because they felt their organization was
 too rigid. Example: Regular staff meeting with 15 people, everyone would sit in the same chairs. When
 they had the meeting with jsut 5 people, they would have to shout at each other because they were too far
 apart. 
 - Solution was to have the CEO and COO change their behavior: they can change seats.
 - In this case, the behavior wasn't too deeply embedded. Changing their own behavior was enough.
